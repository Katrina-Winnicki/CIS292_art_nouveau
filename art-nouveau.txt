	After learning about art nouveau in one of my classes, I created an art nouveau piece on Adobe Illustrator.
I learned about the curves and swirls that where used in the art during that time period. I learned how to use the blob tool in 
Adobe more efficiently in this project and this will help me with other design aspects that are needed.
	My favorite aspect of this project is how it came out. I love how it looks and the swirls of the hair. The risk I took in 
this project was the girl's figure because I feel like my art skill is lacking when drawing figures of humans. 
	One of the problems that I encountered was getting the hair just right. I wanted to fill in the negative space but make
it look like it was laid correctly on the top of her head. I had to adjust the hair layering multiple times. If I could do this 
project over, I would choose a lighter color than black for the background square. I would like to learn more about art during
this era of time.
